In this project, you’ll create a signup or login system for users on a website. The login/signup project is important because many organizations’ websites have an authentication layer embedded in them.

For this project, you’ll need knowledge of programming languages like Python, PHP, or NodeJS.

What we love: This project challenges your fundamentals. You’ll need to strengthen your “muscles” and learn about cookies, working with databases, using SQL, MongoDB, and authorization.
